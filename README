                                      MythMPD

MythMPD is a simple MPD client for MythTV.

FEATURES
--------

- shows current playing song information - title/artist/album/elapsed/total time
- shows current playlist
- basic play/pause/stop/next/previous track keyboard/remote controls
- volume up/down/mute
- load pre-existing playlists
- load all songs by selected artist

There is (currently?) no advanced support for playlist management; i.e. you cannot add songs to the playlist. You will have to use a rich client on another machine for this.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

You will need MythTV installed with the MythMusic plugin.

tar -jxvf mythmpd.tar.bz2
cd mythmpd
qmake mythmpd.pro
make
make install


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Currently, MythMPD can only connect to the mpd daemon running on localhost on the default port. If you need to change this, change the source code.


RUNNING
-------

To test it:

mythfrontend mythmpd

To install in mythtv, add the following to /usr/share/mythtv/library.xml

<button>
<type>MPD_MYTH</type>
<text>MythMPD</text>
<action>PLUGIN mythmpd</action>
</button>

I usually add a key binding for the "MythMPD" jump point and configure my remote to use that jump point.


DISCLAIMER
----------

Er, this is a hack that I wittled up one day for my own use. I'm not a C programmer, so I dismiss any eyebrows raised at the quality of the code.
